# The Temelpa Take-Home Assignment

Please create a private version of this repo, complete the objectives, and once you
are finished, send a zip of your repo to us.

# The Assignment

In this repo, you're given an incomplete version of
[TodoMVC](https://todomvc.com/). The assignment is to first finish
it, and then add a few extensions on top of the TodoMVC. What
exists in the repository was taken from a boilerplate implementation,
if you want to radically refactor the code go right ahead.

The following are the objectives you'll need to complete to finish the
take-home.

### Objective 1: Finish The Implementation

The repo starts you off with implmentations of the individual components without
implementing global state management. Additionally, there may or may not be
small bugs in the components' implementation. So don't assume that you don't
need to modify the components. Your goal is to finish the TodoMVC implementation,
you may look at existing implementations (of course excluding their source code)
to see what you'll need to do.

Once you're done, the implementation should behave exactly the same way as the other
TodoMVC implementations you've seen.

### Objective 2: Undo/Redo

Add two buttons at the footer to allow the user to undo or redo any change the user has made.

## Turning In A Solution

Prior to turning in your solution, create a change-log that outlines each commit. 
we'll likely ask you to go over some of your thinking and design choices later so it'll be
helpful for you to collect some of that in writing as you complete the assignment.

Once you're done, just send us an email of your solution zipped. Remember to remove `node_modules/` 
and `.next/` before creating the zip. 

## Assumptions

You should be able to complete this assignment without importing any additional dependencies.

We expect you to work as if this task was a normal project at work. So please write
your code in a way that fits your intuitive notion of operating within best practices.
ydditionally, you should at the very least have a different commmit for each individual objective,
Ideally, more as you go through process of completing the take-home. Also we like
to see your thought process and fixes as you make changes. So don't be afraid of
committing code that you later edit. No need to squash those commits.

Many parts of the assignment is intentionally ambiguious. If you have a question, definitely
reach out. But for many of these ambiguiuties, we want to see how you independently make
software design decisions.
